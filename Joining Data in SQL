Begin by selecting all columns from the cities table, using the SQL shortcut that selects all.
-- Select all columns from cities
SELECT *
FROM cities;


Perform an inner join with the cities table on the left and the countries table on the right; you do not need to alias tables here.
Join ON the country_code and code columns, making sure you identify them with the correct table.
SELECT * 
FROM cities
-- Inner join to countries
INNER JOIN countries
-- Match on country codes
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;

Complete the SELECT statement to keep three columns: the name of the city, the name of the country, and the region the country is located in (in this order).
Alias the name of the city AS city and the name of the country AS country.
-- Select name fields (with alias) and region 
SELECT cities.name AS city, countries.name AS country, 
countries.region
FROM cities 
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;


    Start with your inner join in line 5; join the tables countries AS c (left) with economies (right), aliasing economies AS e.
    Next, use code as your joining field in line 7; do not use the USING command here.
    Lastly, select the following columns in order in line 2: code from the countries table (aliased as country_code), name, year, and inflation_rate.

-- Select fields with aliases
SELECT c.code AS country_code, name, year, inflation_rate
FROM countries AS c
-- Join to economies (alias e)
INNER JOIN economies AS e
-- Match on code field using table aliases
ON c.code = e.code;


what is the best way to query all the different languages spoken in a country? 
Or, all the countries that speak a certain language?
SELECT c.name AS country, l.name AS language
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN languages AS l
USING(code)
WHERE l.name = 'Bhojpuri';

Suppose you are interested in the relationship between fertility and unemployment rates. 
Your task in this exercise is to join tables to return the country name, year, fertility rate, 
and unemployment rate in a single result from the countries, populations and economies tables.


    Do an inner join of countries AS c (left) with populations AS p (right), on code.
    Select name, year and fertility_rate.
-- Select relevant fields
SELECT name, year, fertility_rate 
-- Inner join countries and populations, aliased, on code
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code;


    Chain an inner join with the economies table AS e, on code.
    Select year and unemployment_rate from the economies table.
-- Select fields
SELECT name, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
-- Join to economies (as e)
INNER JOIN economies as e
-- Match on country code
ON c.code = e.code;


    Modify your query so that you are joining to economies on year as well as code.
SELECT name, e.year, fertility_rate, unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON c.code = e.code
-- Add an additional joining condition such that you are also joining on year
	AND e.year = p.year;
