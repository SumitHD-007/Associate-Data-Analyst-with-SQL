SQL = Structured Query Language

VARCHAR is very commonly used for storing strings. INT a common SQL integer data type can store less than negative two billion to more that positive two billion. Numeric digits stores upto 38 digits total.
Schema are the blueprint of databases.
if we like to select all field in the table we can use asterisk(*)

Excercises:
-- Return all titles from the books table
SELECT title
FROM books

-- Select title and author from the books table
SELECT title,author
FROM books;

-- Select all fields from the books table
SELECT *
FROM books;

Aliasing = For renaming columns in the table. (AS)
DISTINCT = no repeat values
A view refers to a virtual table that is the result of a saved SQL SELECT statement. Its not generally use in the database rather its store in queue for the future use.
-- Select unique authors and genre combinations from the books table
SELECT DISTINCT author,genre
FROM books;

-- Alias author so that it becomes unique_author
SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author
FROM books;

-- Your code to create the view:
CREATE VIEW library_authors AS
SELECT DISTINCT author AS unique_author
FROM books;

-- Select all columns from library_authors
SELECT unique_author
from library_authors

-- Select the first 10 genres from books using PostgreSQL
SELECT genre
FROM books
LIMIT 10;
